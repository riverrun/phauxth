Phauxth is an authentication library for Phoenix, and other Plug-based,
web applications. It is designed to be secure, extensible, easy to use
and well-documented.

For a general overview of some of the goals of Phauxth and its basic usage,
see [this post](https://riverrun.github.io/projects/phauxth/2017/09/25/phauxth.html).

## Getting started

[This guide](https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth/wiki/Getting-started)
shows how you can set up a new Phoenix project with Phauxth.

## Authentication and authorization

The core Phauxth library handles authentication, verifying who the
user is.

For information about authorization, or access control, see the
[Authorization](https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth/wiki/Authorization) page
in the wiki.

If you have set up your app using the [Phauxth installer](https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth_installer),
the `authorize.ex` file in the controllers directory provides examples
of functions you can use to authorize users' access to resources.

## Example apps using Phauxth
